    Identify the (de novo) consensus algorithm we expect to deliver
    the best results, given the sequencing chemistries represented in
    an alignment file.

    We key off the sequencing chemistries as follows:

    - Just RS chemistry data?  Then use quiver (at least for now, until
      we get arrow > quiver on P6-C4)
    - Else (either all Sequel data, or a mix of Sequel and RS data),
      use arrow.
    - Unknown chemistry found? Return None; we should abort if this is found

    Note that the handling/rejection of chemistry mixtures (including
    mixtures of Sequel and RS data) is left to the algorithm itself.
